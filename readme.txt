**Why do I need a Terms & Conditions?**

A Terms & Conditions can be used to enforce community guidelines, copyright protection and termination rules that you will want to have for your website.

**Why do I need a Privacy Policy?**

Personal information can be anything that can identify an individual: email address, names, addresses and so on.

**When do I need to inform users about updating my legal pages?**

You can inform users before and after you have updated your legal pages with new terms. Currently, Legalpack "Update Notices of Legal Pages" Kit allows you to automatically inform users after you have updated your legal pages.

Simply enable the "Update Notices of Legal Pages" Kit and whenever you will update your legal pages, Legalpack will show an announcement bar through your website for a limited time.

One of the requirements of the EU Cookies Directive is to inform users about the use of cookies through your website.

The EU Cookies Directive may contain more requirements that you may need to be aware of. Please read our guide on this: https://termsfeed.com/blog/eu-cookies-directive/
